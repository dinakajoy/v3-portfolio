description: "A step-by-step guide to building a GraphQL API with Apollo Server, Express.js, MongoDB, RBAC, Authorization, and Data Loader"
---

GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. When combined with Apollo Server, Express.js, and MongoDB, you can build a flexible, performant, and secure backend for modern applications. Integrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Authorization ensures fine-grained access control, while DataLoader helps avoid the N+1 query problem common in GraphQL.

This guide walks you through setting up a robust GraphQL API using:

- Apollo Server for building the GraphQL layer
- Express.js for middleware and server handling
- MongoDB for data persistence
- RBAC and Authorization for secure access control, together with GraphQL Shield
- DataLoader for batching and caching database queries efficiently
