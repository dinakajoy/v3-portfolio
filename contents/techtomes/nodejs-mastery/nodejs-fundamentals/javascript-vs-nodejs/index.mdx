# JavaScript vs Node.js

## 3.1 JavaScript in the Browser vs Node.js

Understanding the difference between **JavaScript in the browser** and **JavaScript running in Node.js** is crucial to mastering backend development with NodeJS.

JavaScript was originally designed to run in the **browser** to enhance user interfaces, validate forms, and interact with the DOM (Document Object Model). But thanks to **Node.js**, JavaScript can now run **outside the browser**, typically on servers.

| Feature       | Browser JavaScript                                           | Node.js JavaScript                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime       | Runs inside browsers like Chrome, Firefox                    | Runs on the server using V8 engine                   |
| Environment   | Has access to the `window`, `document`, `localStorage`, etc. | Has access to `file system`, `http`, `process`, etc. |
| Use Case      | Building interactive UIs                                     | Building APIs, CLIs, backend logic                   |
| Global Object | `window`                                                     | `global`                                             |
| Module System | ES Modules (via `<script type="module">`)                    | CommonJS (`require`), or ES Modules                  |
| APIs          | DOM, BOM, `fetch`, `alert`                                   | `fs`, `http`, `os`, `process`, etc.                  |

## 3.2 Differences Between Node.js and Frontend JavaScript

Here are some key technical distinctions:

### Frontend JavaScript

- Can manipulate the DOM
- Used for animations, event handling, User Interface logic
- Limited access to the system for security reasons
- Works with `window`, `document`, `fetch`, etc.

### Node.js

- Cannot access the DOM or `window`
- Can read/write files, access databases, and start HTTP servers
- Uses CommonJS (`require`) or native ECMAScript Module
- Offers powerful built-in modules like:
  - `fs` for file system operations
  - `http` for building web servers
  - `path` for file paths
  - `events` for handling events
    and much more.

### Example

```javascript
// Node.js - Reading a file
const fs = require("fs");

fs.readFile("example.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

This would not work in browser JavaScript.

## 3.3 Asynchronous Nature of Node.js

One of Node.js’s superpowers is its non-blocking, asynchronous nature.  
Node.js uses an event-driven architecture.
It doesn’t wait for operations (like file reads, database queries) to finish before moving on.
This makes it highly efficient and scalable, especially for I/O heavy applications.

### Blocking (Synchronous) Example:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

// Blocks further execution
const data = fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf8");
console.log(data);
```

### Non-blocking (Asynchronous) Example:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

// Does not blocks further execution
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
console.log("File read initiated...");
```

### Some Key Concepts in NodeJS:

- Callback functions – Core to handling async operations
- Promises & async/await – Modern and cleaner way to manage async flow
- Event Loop – The engine behind async behavior in Node.js

Asynchronous programming is what allows Node.js to serve thousands of requests efficiently without creating a new thread for each one.
