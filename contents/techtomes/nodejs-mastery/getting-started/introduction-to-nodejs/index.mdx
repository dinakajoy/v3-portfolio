# Introduction to Node.js

## 1.1 What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside the browser. Built on Chrome’s **V8 JavaScript engine**, Node.js enables the development of scalable and high-performance applications, especially for backend services like APIs, microservices, and real-time applications.

## 1.2 History and Evolution of Node.js
Node.js was created by **Ryan Dahl** in **2009** as a solution to the limitations of synchronous programming in traditional web servers. Before Node.js, most web servers were **blocking (synchronous)**, leading to performance bottlenecks. Ryan Dahl introduced the **event-driven, non-blocking I/O model** to improve performance and scalability. Over time, Node.js gained popularity and became a critical tool in modern web development.

### Key Milestones in Node.js History
- **2009** – Node.js was released by Ryan Dahl.
- **2010** – npm (Node Package Manager) was introduced.
- **2015** – Node.js Foundation was formed; io.js was merged back into Node.js.
- **2018** – Node.js introduced **worker threads** for multi-threading support.
- **2021 - Present** – Node.js continues to evolve with new ECMAScript features and performance improvements.

## 1.3 Why Use Node.js?
Node.js offers several advantages that make it a preferred choice for backend development:

### Performance and Scalability
- **Non-blocking, Asynchronous I/O** – Handles multiple requests simultaneously without waiting for previous operations to complete.
- **Event-driven Architecture** – Efficiently manages concurrent connections, making it ideal for real-time applications.
- **Built on the V8 Engine** – Executes JavaScript at high speed, as V8 compiles JavaScript into machine code.

### Unified JavaScript Stack
- With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript for both frontend and backend development, leading to a seamless development experience.

### Large Ecosystem and Community Support
- **npm (Node Package Manager)** provides thousands of reusable modules.
- Active community with extensive resources and frequent updates.

### Use Cases of Node.js
- **Backend for Web Applications** – RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, authentication systems.
- **Real-Time Applications** – Chat applications, collaboration tools, gaming servers.
- **Microservices** – Lightweight and modular architecture for scalable applications.
- **Command-Line Tools** – Build automation scripts and CLI utilities.

## 1.4 Installation and REPL

### Installing Node.js
To start building with Node.js, the first step is installing it on your machine.

#### Installation Methods

##### 1. Official Installer (Recommended for Beginners)
- Visit [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- Download the **LTS version** (recommended for most users)
- Follow the installation steps according to your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

##### 2. Using Node Version Manager (NVM)
Great for developers who need to switch between Node versions.

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc depending on your shell
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

**Windows:** Use nvm-windows
Windows: Use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

#### Verifying Installation
After installation, confirm it's working:

```bash
node -v    # Displays Node.js version
npm -v     # Displays npm version
```

### Understanding the REPL
REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop, and it's an interactive shell for running Node.js code snippets.

#### How to Start the REPL
Open your terminal and type:

```bash
node
```

You will enter the interactive environment where you can execute JavaScript/Node.js code line by line.

#### REPL Workflow
- Read: Takes your input.
- Eval: Evaluates the input.
- Print: Outputs the result.
- Loop: Waits for the next input.

#### Sample REPL Session
```bash
> 2 + 3
5
> const name = "Odinaka"
undefined
> name.toUpperCase()
'ODINAKA'
```

#### Useful REPL Commands
- .help – Displays REPL commands.
- .exit – Exits the REPL.
- _ – Refers to the last evaluated result.

REPL is a great tool for experimenting with Node.js features and testing logic without creating files. It's especially handy for quick debugging and learning the language interactively.

## 1.5 Writing and Running Your First Node.js Script

## Overview
Node.js has revolutionized backend development by providing a fast, scalable, and efficient environment for running JavaScript outside the browser. Its event-driven, non-blocking architecture makes it an excellent choice for modern applications. With a strong ecosystem and a unified JavaScript stack, Node.js continues to be a dominant force in web development.
